# stock-prediction-lstm
This project is designed to predict stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its effectiveness in handling sequential data. The project aims to provide a practical and customizable solution for forecasting stock prices, which can be used for investment or trading strategies.

Key Features and Components:

Data Collection: The project includes scripts or tools to gather historical stock price data. This data can be collected from various sources such as APIs or publicly available datasets.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. The project provides code for cleaning and transforming raw data into a format suitable for training the LSTM model.

LSTM Model: The heart of the project is the LSTM neural network. The model is implemented using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. It includes customizable hyperparameters for training the model.

Training: The LSTM model is trained on the historical stock price data. The training process involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, defining loss functions, and optimizing model parameters.

Evaluation: The project offers various evaluation metrics and visualization tools to assess the performance of the LSTM model in predicting stock prices. Common metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to measure prediction accuracy.

Prediction: After training, the LSTM model can be used to make future stock price predictions. Users can input historical data and get predictions for future time periods.

User Interface (Optional): Some projects may include a user-friendly interface, such as a web application, where users can input stock data and visualize predictions.

Documentation: A comprehensive README and documentation are provided to guide users on setting up the project, installing dependencies, and using the prediction model effectively.

Licensing and Usage: The project should include information about its licensing, and potential users should be aware of any restrictions or terms for usage and modification.

Contribution and Collaboration: Open-source projects often encourage collaboration and contributions from the community. Contributors may submit improvements, bug fixes, or additional features to enhance the project.

This project is designed to empower developers and data scientists to experiment with LSTM-based stock price prediction models and gain insights into the world of financial forecasting. Users can customize the model for specific stocks, timeframes, and strategies, making it a valuable resource for those interested in the intersection of deep learning and finance.
